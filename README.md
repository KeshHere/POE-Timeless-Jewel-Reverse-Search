# POE-Timeless-Jewel-Reverse-Search
Let's make sure you don't roll over a good jewel...

Please look at https://github.com/KeshHere/TimelessJewelData if you use just the CSVs for your use as there have been some changes

    This is still in beta, so if you encounter any bugs or mistakes please feel free to let me know. You need all 5 CSV files and 
    source file .au3 to run the program.



All the files needed to run are in the Zip format. It includes 5 CSV dataset for 5 different Jewels and 1 .au3 file which contains source code.


Source Code running: (This is the only way to run latest releases)

        It is written in AutoIt3, it is like AHK but I know better about AutoIt3 than AHK so I chose this. 
        Here is the link to the page to download AutoIt3 official https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/
        After installing, just double click .au3 file to run the program.



Direct running: (Not possible for latest release)
        
        After downloading the zip file and extracting the data, you can just double click ".exe" to run it directly.
        
        I have decided to remove executable file from future releases for below reasons
            -AutoHotKey and AutoIt both are frequently used by script kiddies and hackers for easy malicious apps
            -This causes many false positives in various anti-viruses and people panic over it (rightfully so)
            -This false positives can lead to banning of my Github profile, it happened last month with other tool dev

    
        

NOTE: (For old releases)

        As I do not have my own license to distribute [it costs like 300-600$ per year] the .exe file provided is un-signed. That means 
        that windows firewall or antiviruses will not be able to identify it as legit .exe file from some company. That will lead to 
        False positive in both cases. 

        In any case, it is good practise to not run .exe from unknown sources so I don't blame you. If you don't trust the app, you can 
        always run the Source Code itself after reading through it.
