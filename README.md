# POE-Timeless-Jewel-Reverse-Search
Let's make sure you don't roll over a good jewel...



    This is still in beta, so if you encounter any bugs or mistakes please feel free to let me know. You need all 5 CSV files and 
    either .exe or source file .au3 to run the program.



All the files needed to run are in the Zip format. It includes 5 CSV dataset for 5 different Jewels, 1 .exe file for direct run, and 1 .au3 file which contains source code.

Direct running:
        
        After downloading the zip file and extracting the data, you can just double click "POE Jewel Finder.exe" to run it directly.
    
Source Code running:

        It is written in AutoIt3, it is like AHK but I know better about AutoIt3 than AHK so I chose this. 
        Here is the link to the page to download AutoIt3 https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/
        After installing, just double click .au3 file to run the program.


NOTE:

        As I do not have my own license to distribute [it costs like 300-600$ per year] the .exe file provided is un-signed. That means 
        that windows firewall or antiviruses will not be able to identify it as legit .exe file from some company. That will lead to 
        False positive in both cases. 

        In any case, it is good practise to not run .exe from unknown sources so I don't blame you. If you don't trust the app, you can 
        always run the Source Code itself after reading through it.
